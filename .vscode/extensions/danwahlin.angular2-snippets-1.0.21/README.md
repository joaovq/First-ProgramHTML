In addition to typing the snippet prefix, you can also press Ctrl+Space on Windows or Linux, or Cmd+Space on Mac to activate the snippets.

## Installing the Angular TypeScript and HTML Snippets

```
Windows:  Select Ctrl+P and then type: ext install angular2-snippets
Mac:      Select ⌘+P and then type: ext install angular2-snippets 
```

After restarting the editor open a TypeScript file and type the “ag-” prefix to see the snippets.

NOTE: The VS Code extension gallery doesn’t allow projects to be renamed after they are initially created so “angular2-snippets” will get you the latest version of the snippets even though “2” is in the name.
